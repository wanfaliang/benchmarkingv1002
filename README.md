Financial Analysis Platform 
I am going to build a web-based application for financial and equity analysis and modeling based on the application (Version Zero) I built which can create financial and equity analysis and modeling and comprehensive Word format reports. 
The idea is to convert the output in the format of Word document into interactive web interface while keeping the features and functionalities of Version Zero.
1. Introduction of Version Zero:
Data infrastructure of Version Zero
FREDCollector
FinancialDataCollection
Analysis and Reporting Section of Version Zero
It covers such sections:
•	Section 0 – Cover & Metadata
•	Section 1 – Executive Summary
•	Section 2 – Company Classification & Factor Tags
•	Section 3 – Financial Overview & Historical Analysis
•	Section 4 – Profitability & Returns Analysis
•	Section 5 – Liquidity, Solvency & Capital Structure
•	Section 6 – Workforce & Productivity Analysis
•	Section 7 – Valuation Analysis
•	Section 8 – Macroeconomic Environment Analysis
•	Section 9 – Signal Discovery & Macro-Financial Analysis
•	Section 10 – Regimes & Scenario Analysis
•	Section 11 – Risk & Alert Panel
•	Section 12 – Peer Context & Comparative Analysis
•	Section 13 – Institutional Ownership Dynamics
•	Section 14 – Insider Activity & Corporate Sentiment
•	Section 15 – Market Microstructure Analysis
•	Section 16 – Benchmark Relative Analysis
•	Section 17 – Cross-Asset Signal Discovery
•	Section 18 – Equity Analysis & Investment Risk Assessment
•	Section 19 – Appendix (Extended Tables, Methodology, Data Dictionary, Disclaimers)


2. What We're Building
Transform Version Zero → Interactive Web Platform
Core Difference:
•	Version Zero: User runs Python script → Gets static Word document
•	Web Platform: User submits tickers via web → Gets the desired pages or tabs, such as data review, data download, or 20 HTML pages. For this development stage, we still generate static HTML pages, with the goal to reuse the code of Version Zero as much as possible, only trying to use as more interactive elements which are available for web pages. But for now, the structures of the sections are fixed, same as Version Zero, only their elements, such as tables or charts, can be interactive.

3. Main User Flow
1. Login/Register
   ↓
2. Dashboard (View all analyses)
   ↓
3. Create New Analysis
   • Input: Company tickers (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
   • Input: Years of history (default: 10)
   • Click "Analyze"
   ↓
4. Phase A: Data Collection
  • In Version Zero, it has a class FRECollector which collects economic indicators and put them in a separate Excel file for sharing so that each analysis doesn't have to repeatedly collect economic indicators as they don't change every minute or hour or even every day. FRECollector does periodically update the indicators.
 
• Shows progress, like the following: 
✓ Collecting profiles...
✓ Collecting statements/ratios/key-metrics...

✓ Raw collection complete
   • User sees what's being collected in real-time
   • When done: Review Data screen
   • Download raw data (Excel, contains all raw data sheets) 
• Start Analysis
   ↓
5. Phase B (click Start Analysis: Analysis Generation (20 Sections). This is to reuse most of the code of Version Zero (Python-based Word document generator) into a web-based platform while maintaining 95% code reuse.
   • Shows progress, such as the following: 
Section 0: ✅ Complete
Section 1: ✅ Complete
Section 2: ❌ Failed (error message)
Section 3: 🔄 Processing
Section 4: ⏳ In Queue
Section 5: ⏳ In Queue
...
Section 18: ⏳ In Queue
Section 19: ⏳ In Queue
   • Sections unlock as they complete
   • User can read Section 1-5 while 6-20 ae in process
• Users can download full set of reports when they are ready

   ↓
6. Report Viewer
   • 20 tabs/sections (like tabs in browser)
   
•Users can download each section when they are ready, can choose in the formats of Word or HTML.HTML pages are ready for downloading, if the users choose to download in Word format, the backend would call Version Zero and offer download link.
